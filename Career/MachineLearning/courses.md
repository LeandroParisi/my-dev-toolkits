Courses:
https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ Specializations - ML, Maths for ML, Deep learning from here are good

Foundational stuff:
NLP:
there's a good list https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/ here, afraid I don't know any specific courses on these GPT does a lot of these for us pretty well now (sentiment analysis, generation, translation, completion) https://platform.openai.com/examples

in particular:
named entity recognition (e.g. spacy, ntlk packages)
pattern matching
stemming/lemmatization, stop words removal, tokenization
embeddings e.g. word2vec, bag of words

ML:
scikitlearn (basic ML models)
linear/logistic regression
randomforest/xgboost

SVM
KNN
keras/pytorch (neural nets)
LSTM
NLP (e.g. MNIST dataset)
metrics (precision, recall, AUC-ROC), bias, variance
imbalanced data
Data Science:
Clustering
Kmeans
PCA
 hierarchical clustering HDBSCAN
segmentation, grouping
feature engineering (onehot encoding etc)
time-series analysis
data visualizations + presentations

Stats:
a/b (hypothesis) testing
bayesian e.g. hierarchical modelling (optional, don't really need this)
data cleaning (normalisation, nulls)
