How do I get started at work? Tax in Ireland? - Please see attached Spreadsheet with tax Breakdown  

  
When working in Ireland you will need a PPS number, this is similar to a social security number. PPS number is your Personal Public Service Number. It is a unique number just for you, it helps you access social welfare services, public services, and information in Ireland. It is important for your employer to have your PPS number to sort your tax correctly. (You will also need a PPS number to open a bank account)  

  
To get your PPS number you need three things:  

Passport  

Proof of Address  

Proof of Employment  

  

It is best if your employer can post your proof of employment to your house and that will cover you for both proofs of address and proof of employment. (Alternatively, a bill that is in your name)  

  
  

When you have all three items, you must bring them to your local Social Welfare Office. There always tends to be big queues in the social welfare office so allow yourself the time. You only have to do this once!! You can get your PPS number the next day over the phone!  

  

Banking: How do I set up my bank account?

Setting up a bank account is quite simple and there are a variety of banks you can choose from, so take your time and look around to find a bank that suits you!
