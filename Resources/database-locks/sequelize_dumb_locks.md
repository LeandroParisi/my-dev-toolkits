Certainly! In Sequelize, the lock modes correspond to common database lock types. Here's how you can match each Sequelize lock mode to its equivalent in typical database lock terminology:

Transaction.LOCK.UPDATE (or true):

Equivalent Database Lock Type: Update Lock
Description: This lock mode is similar to an update lock in traditional database systems. It prevents other transactions from acquiring a lock on the same rows for update until the current transaction is committed or rolled back.
Transaction.LOCK.SHARE (or Transaction.LOCK.READ):

Equivalent Database Lock Type: Shared Lock
Description: This lock mode allows multiple transactions to read from the same rows concurrently. However, it prevents other transactions from acquiring a lock for writing on those rows until the current transaction is committed or rolled back.
Transaction.LOCK.KEY_SHARE (or Transaction.LOCK.WRITE):

Equivalent Database Lock Type: Intent Lock (Shared + Update)
Description: This lock mode allows concurrent reading and writing to the same rows. It prevents other transactions from acquiring a lock for writing on those rows until the current transaction is committed or rolled back. It combines aspects of both shared and update locks.
It's important to note that the terminology and behavior may vary slightly between different database systems, but the concepts generally align with common locking mechanisms used in databases. The specific details of how locks are implemented can depend on the underlying database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).
