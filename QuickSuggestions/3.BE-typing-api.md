What I'm doing now is I'm defining the API shapes in the planning phase using https://typespec.io/, then:
I output the TypeSpec API Contract as OpenAPI 3.0 YAML.
I use the OpenAPI files for Swagger UI and Redoc.
I use this codegen tool to output Golang structs for the backend to use (a lot more of my backends are written in Go now!): https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen
For the frontent, I'm using openapi-typescript with openapi-fetch to generate type-safe fetch calls (I use them directly in the Next.JS App Router or through Reacy Query on the client side): https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript
