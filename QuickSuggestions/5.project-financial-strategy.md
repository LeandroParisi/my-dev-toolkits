That's up to your own financial position and how much you need or do not need those funds. My advice would be to be able to pay your team and pay yourself at least what you pay them. If there's an amount to be made above that, that's "profit" at that point. Whether you take the profit in cash, share of income, or equity in company is really up to you and negotiating!

I have done it before and not done it, and it seems like I got screwed with both options! That doesn't feel bad if everyone got paid though! (editado)

My friend Gabe always took a small % as revenue share or equity in the company. Over about 10 years he wound up making 3 times an annual salary just in those profit shares. If the companies grow it makes a lot of sense. Not all companies are lucky though!
