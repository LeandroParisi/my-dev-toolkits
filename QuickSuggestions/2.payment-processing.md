They take 5% but they are the merchant of record. They handle all the legal stuff and customer disputes. They’re built for SAAS companies

Stripe with Mercury Bank is the cheaper solution but that setup will not handle VAT compliance if your customers are in Europe

SAAS founders have a split opinion on this. Some believe you should save money (stripe is cheapest and easiest for this, but you won’t get tax compliance). Others think you should let Paddle handle everything until $1 million in revenue, then spend extra time setting up stripe with proper tax compliance. Lots of international founders use Paddle and USA ones use Stripe.
